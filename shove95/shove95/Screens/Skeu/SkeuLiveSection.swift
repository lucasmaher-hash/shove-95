//  The Live tab's own screen: one box, one line of text.
//
//  It is not a list (founder direction 2026-08-17). The other three tabs
//  divide the date line between them and each holds however many tasks fall in
//  its range; this holds exactly one thing, the thing you are doing, and it
//  shows it the size that deserves.
//
//  The live note lives HERE and in no tab — see `TaskItem.isLiveNote`. Typing
//  it puts it on the Lock Screen straight away, because that is the whole
//  point of typing it. The switch afterwards controls only whether it is still
//  showing there; the text stays in this box either way. The bin is what
//  deletes.
//
//  There is no tick. Finishing a live task is something you do from the Lock
//  Screen without opening the app — that is what makes it worth putting there
//  — and a second tick in here would be a second place to look.

/// two round marks side by side asked the reader to tell apart two controls
/// where the page only names one.
