//  Settings in the skeu look — a ROUGH first pass, built to nail the
//  construction before the content is complete. Tab names, workspaces, archive
//  and about still live in the Win95 settings and arrive here in step 4 proper.
//
//  Construction transcribed from the founder's menu study (shove95 file, node
//  2:182, the "Dashboard / Projects 10 / Account / Support" card):
//
//    CARD    a raised sheet: material fill, white rim (7.69 at frame scale),
//            soft shadows falling down-left. ONE CARD PER SETTING — the founder
//            was explicit (2026-08-13) that each setting is its own panel, not
//            sections sharing a sheet. The frame also carries a leather texture
//            and two glow blobs — the texture is out (hard rule: no texture
//            assets; depth from light only), the glows are approximated by a
//            diagonal gradient on the fill.
//    TROUGH  inside each card, the same channel the bars use — gradient,
//            contour, four inner shadows — holding that setting's options.
//    OPTION  a glass pill. Selected = prominent (bright rim, glow, ink label).
//            Resting = subdued (half rim, no glow, muted label) — nodes 1:87
//            vs 1:101.
//
//  Scale: the frame draws its pill text at 27.692 where the phone wants 12.8,
//  so every transcribed value is × 0.4622.
