//  Reading the keyboard's OWN animation off its notification, so a list
//  getting out of its way travels WITH it rather than beside it.
//
//  Both looks dock a focused field the same way and were doing the same
//  arithmetic twice, each animating on a hand-picked `easeOut(0.25)` that had
//  nothing to do with what the keyboard was actually doing. UIKit posts both a
//  duration and a curve; matched, the inset, the lift and the keyboard are one
//  movement instead of three that happen to overlap (founder bug report
//  2026-08-17).
