//  The mark on the Live tab: a ring with a filled core.
//
//  It carries no word (founder direction 2026-08-17). A label would repeat
//  what the shape already says, and the frame is a square — there is room for
//  one or the other, not both.
//
//  A record button is the right borrowing here. Every phone owner already
//  reads ring-around-a-dot as "this is on the air", which is exactly what the
//  Live section means: one thing, showing on the Lock Screen, right now.
