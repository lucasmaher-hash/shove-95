//
//  Dragging a task to a new place in its list, by its own grip.
//
//  This existed once and was cut on 2026-08-04 — "too many gestures
//  interfering with each other" — because the drag lived on the row itself,
//  beside the swipe, the hold and the tap. A grip of its own is the answer to
//  that: the handle owns the drag and nothing else on the row hears it, so
//  none of the four gestures has to guess (founder direction 2026-08-23).
//
//  NOT the system's drag and drop. `onDrag`/`onDrop` is the other reordering
//  people write, and it is a different interaction: a press, a lift, a
//  floating system preview. What Reminders does — and what the founder asked
//  for — starts the moment the finger lands on the grip and follows it one to
//  one. So the drag is a plain gesture and the arithmetic is here.
//
//  The MODEL is: one row leaves its slot and travels; every row it passes
//  closes up behind it by exactly the height of the row that left. That is
//  true whatever the rows are worth in height — a task with photos is taller
//  than one without, and none of this cares.
//
