//  SwipeToDismiss.swift
//  shove95
//
//  Two ways out of a full-screen sheet: in from the left edge, or down from
//  the header.
//
//  Settings, About, How to use and Archive all cover the whole screen, and a
//  full-screen cover has no system dismiss gesture of its own — the ✕ was the
//  only exit. Both looks now take the two gestures people already have in
//  their hands (founder direction 2026-08-17).
//
//  THE LEFT EDGE, not anywhere. A horizontal drag in the middle of a settings
//  screen is a swipe on a task row everywhere else in this app; only a drag
//  that BEGINS at the screen's edge means "back", which is also what iOS
//  itself has taught.
//
//  THE HEADER, not the whole page. A downward drag lower down is a scroll, and
//  a sheet that closes when you try to scroll it is worse than one with no
//  gesture at all.
//
//  Two things the first version got wrong, both worth keeping written down:
//
//  1. It compared the drag's start against a header height measured from the
//     sheet's own top, while `startLocation` is in GLOBAL space and counts the
//     status bar. The band therefore sat above the title rather than on it,
//     and dragging the header did nothing. The safe-area inset is added now,
//     and the band is measured to include the title AND its button.
//
//  2. Offsetting the sheet revealed BLACK. Nothing is behind a full-screen
//     cover — the screen it came from is not rendered underneath — so moving
//     it exposes the void. The Win95 covers ask for a clear presentation
//     background and get the real screen; the skeu ones sit on their own
//     canvas colour, which is what is behind them anyway.
//
//  3. A committed drag used to dismiss on the spot and spring the offset back
//     to zero, so the sheet snapped to the middle and then dropped — the hand
//     threw it one way and the screen answered by throwing it another. It now
//     leaves along the line the drag was already on.
//
