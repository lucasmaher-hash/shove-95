//
//  The complete colour contract of the skeuomorphic design system (§2.2).
//  Swapping the instance in the environment re-skins every screen — that is the
//  acceptance test for the whole system: if a screen needs editing to change
//  theme, the screen is wrong.
//
//  Roles are SEMANTIC (`material`, `recess`, `ink`, `accent`), never literal
//  (`brown`, `cream`). A component that wants "the light brown one" is reaching
//  past the contract.

    /// (founder direction 2026-08-13, from the reference: the red bar and the
    /// leather behind it are the same red).
    ///
    /// This is a deliberate departure from §2.2, which puts canvas below
    /// material in brightness, and it moves the system toward the neumorphic
    /// edge §1.3 warns about. What keeps it out of that ditch is everything
    /// else staying in force: asymmetric directional shadows, a diagonal key
    /// light, and real rim shade. Flat-and-symmetric is what makes neumorphism
    /// mushy — sameness of hue is not.

    /// 0.955×, outline at 0.59× — the proportions between #aa171f, #d7434f and
    /// #85141a against that file's #e03d4a ground.
    /// Light brown, transposed hue-for-hue from the founder's main-screen frame
    /// (shove95 file, node 2:183). Every value below is that frame's red at
    /// hue 28° and 0.41 saturation, with the brightness and saturation RATIOS
    /// between roles preserved exactly:
    ///
    ///   role        frame      B ratio   S ratio
    ///   material    #e03d4a     1.000     1.000

    /// Note that canvas is DARKER than material here. The nav-bar reference had
    /// them equal, and that reading was carried over too eagerly — the finished
    /// screen puts its cards on a deeper ground, and the cards are what the
    /// white rim is drawn against.
    /// LIGHT means light (founder direction 2026-08-16). The values below used
    /// to be a mid-brown carrying white text — the frame this look was
    /// transcribed from is the DARK one, and the light half inherited its
    /// white-on-brown relationship at a slightly raised brightness. It read as
    /// a dimmer dark theme, and it measured 3.42:1 against a 4.5:1 bar.
    ///
    /// The base moves to 0.88 brightness and the ink to near-black. Every
    /// other role is the SAME multiplier of the base as before, so the ladder
    /// — near wall at 0.76×, floor at 0.955×, contour at 0.60×, lit lip at
    /// 1.02× — is unchanged. Only where the ladder stands has moved.
    ///
    /// Two things had to be re-thought rather than re-scaled, because light
    /// material does not behave like dark material:
    ///
    /// **The rim needs headroom.** `edgeLight` is white, and `materialTop` was
    /// `base × 1.10`. At a light base that clamps to white as well, and a
    /// white rim on a white surface is no rim at all. The top stop is held at
    /// 0.93 so the rim still out-shines what it sits on.
    ///
    /// **Shadow does the work now.** On a dark surface a bright rim carries
    /// the depth; on a light one there is nowhere brighter to go, so the
    /// contact shade and the drop shadow are what separate an object from the
    /// page. `edgeShade` and `shadow` therefore keep their strength instead of
    /// being lightened along with everything else.
