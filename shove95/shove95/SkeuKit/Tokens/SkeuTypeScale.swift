//  SkeuTypeScale.swift
//  shove95
//
//  Dynamic Type for the skeu look (FR-015).
//
//  The Win95 side scales by redefining its `pixel` unit in whole steps, which
//  works because every value there is expressed in 1995 pixels. The skeu look
//  has no such unit — its sizes come from a Figma frame — so it needs its own
//  mechanism, and this is it: ONE multiplier in the environment that the size
//  tokens read.
//
//  Why a multiplier rather than `@ScaledMetric` at each call site:
//
//  · The tokens are static constants on a private `enum F`, consumed in ~40
//    places across rows, bars, pills and glyphs. `@ScaledMetric` is a property
//    wrapper and cannot live on a static, so adopting it would mean threading
//    forty stored properties through every view.
//  · The bars are FIXED-HEIGHT chrome. Text inside them has to grow, but the
//    trough cannot grow without breaking the layout it was transcribed from.
//    A single multiplier lets type and geometry scale on different curves —
//    see `text` versus `chrome` below.
//
//  Capped deliberately. Beyond ~1.6× the four tab labels stop fitting a phone
//  width at any sane truncation, so the ladder flattens rather than shipping a
//  bar that reads "Tod… Tom… We… Gen…". The accessibility sizes still gain a
//  lot over the default; they just stop short of destroying the layout.
//
