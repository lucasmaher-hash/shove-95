//  SkeuSegmented.swift

//
//  THE toggle of this design: a trough holding equal-width segments, of which
//  only the selected one wears glass.
//
//  It appears twice — the main screen's tab bar, and every option row in
//  settings — and the two are defined HERE rather than separately, because a
//  settings toggle that differs from the tab bar reads as a different kind of
//  control (founder direction 2026-08-14). Sharing the construction is the
//  only way that stays true as either side is edited.
//
//  Sizes are the tab bar's, resolved from the Figma frame: 148.2 × s × scaleUp
//  for the height, 41 for the label, 22 and 23.771 for the pill's padding,
//  where s = 402/1495 and scaleUp = 37/(107.444 × s). Written out as numbers
//  because SkeuKit cannot see the screen's private frame table.
