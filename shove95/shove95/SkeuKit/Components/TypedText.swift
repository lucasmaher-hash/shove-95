//
//  TypedText.swift
//  shove95
//
//  Text that types itself out when the typeface under it changes.
//
//  Swapping a face is the one setting whose effect is the TEXT ITSELF, and it
//  used to happen between two frames — every label on the screen was suddenly
//  a different shape and nothing said why. Typing it out makes the change the
//  subject rather than a side effect: you see the words being set again in the
//  face you just chose (founder direction 2026-08-16).
//
//  Belongs to BOTH looks. The trigger is passed in rather than read here, so a
//  Win95 label reacts to `AppFace` and a skeu one to the skeu face, and
//  neither has to know about the other's setting.
//
//  Style rides the OUTSIDE: `.font`, `.foregroundStyle`, `.tracking` and the
//  rest are ordinary View modifiers and reach the Text inside, so a call site
//  keeps the styling it already had and only changes what it wraps.
//
//  The first appearance never types. A row scrolling into a lazy list has not
//  changed face; it was simply not on screen yet, and typing it out there
//  would make the list look like it was loading.
//
