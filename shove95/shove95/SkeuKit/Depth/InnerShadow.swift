//  InnerShadow.swift
//  shove95
//
//  SwiftUI has no inner shadow, so one is built the standard way: stroke the
//  shape with a thick line, offset it, blur it, then mask it back to the shape
//  so only the part that falls INSIDE survives (§4.5).
//
//  COST, and why the plural version exists. Each of those is two offscreen
//  render passes — one for the blur, one for the mask — and a trough wants
//  FOUR inner shadows (lip, far wall, two diagonals). Applied one at a time
//  that is eight passes per trough, recomputed every frame the trough moves,
//  because a blur is not cached by SwiftUI on its own.
//
//  The settings sheet is where that bill comes due: it stands up roughly
//  eleven troughs and thirteen glass pills, against one or two troughs on the
//  home screen. Same scrolling, same data — the only difference was how many
//  of these stacks were live, which is why the skeu sheet dropped frames while
//  the Win95 one (flat fills, no blur anywhere) never did.
//
//  So: mask ONCE for the whole set, and rasterise the result. These layers are
//  static for a given size and palette, so `drawingGroup` composites them into
//  a single texture that is then translated as the screen scrolls rather than
//  re-blurred.
//
//  Rasterising is safe HERE and nowhere else in this kit, for one reason:
//  `drawingGroup` renders a subtree at its LAYOUT BOUNDS, and the mask has
//  already confined these shadows to the shape. An effect that is meant to
//  spread past its own frame — the glass lens highlight, the segmented
//  trough's bloom overhang — comes back with a square cut at the edge if it is
//  grouped (founder bug report 2026-08-16). Check the bleed before reaching
//  for this.
//
//  Do NOT put a `Material` inside one of these either — a material has to
//  sample the backdrop and cannot do that from inside a rasterised group.
