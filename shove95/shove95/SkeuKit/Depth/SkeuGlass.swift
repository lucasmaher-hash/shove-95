//  The glass pill, transcribed from the isolated component (shove95 file, node
//  4:882 — a 221.31 × 104.54 button). It has NO fill of its own. What makes it
//  read as a lens, outside in:
//
//    shadows   a five-stop ladder falling straight down
//              0/81.44/22.68 @0     · 0/52.57/20.62 @.01 · 0/29.90/17.53 @.05
//              0/13.40/13.40 @.09   · 0/3.09/7.22   @.10
//    rim       2.971 of white at 0.5 alpha, the whole way round
//    glow      an ELLIPTICAL white gradient centred BELOW the pill
//              (111.02, 125.83 in a 221.31 × 104.54 box → x 0.5, y 1.20),
//              blended plus-lighter at 0.5 — additive, so it brightens
//              without tinting
//    lenses    five stacked layers, each rgba(255,255,255,0.01), each inset
//              further than the last, the group blurred by 3.281
//
//  The lens stack is the part that is easy to get backwards. Each layer is
//  SMALLER than the one below it, so the alphas accumulate toward the MIDDLE:
//  ~5% at the centre, 1% at the rim. An earlier build had a rim-weighted
//  gradient instead — brightest at the edge — which is the exact inverse and
//  read as a chrome ring rather than as thickness.
//
//  In Figma each layer also carries a backdrop-blur (41 → 20.5 → 10.25 → 4.1 →
//  0.82), giving true progressive refraction. SwiftUI's only backdrop-blur
//  primitive is `Material`, whose radius is fixed and which tints neutral grey
//  — it drains the hue straight out of the lens, which was tried and rejected.
//  What is kept is the layer geometry and the group blur; on the near-flat
//  surfaces this sits on, there is nothing behind it to refract anyway.
//
