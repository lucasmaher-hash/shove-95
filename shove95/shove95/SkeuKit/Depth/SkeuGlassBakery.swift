//  SkeuGlassBakery.swift

//
//  The glass lens stack, rendered once and reused — the old trick, applied to
//  a new toolkit.
//
//  Skeuomorphic interfaces were never slow. The iOS that looked like this
//  drew leather and felt and brushed steel on hardware a fraction of what a
//  phone has now, and it did it at sixty frames a second, because none of it
//  was being COMPUTED while you scrolled. It was pictures. The chip copied a
//  texture into place and moved on (founder direction 2026-08-22).
//
//  What was expensive here was never the drawing — a device trace put the GPU
//  at 5% of its budget. It was the BUILDING: five concentric shapes, five
//  padding pairs, a Gaussian blur and a gradient, constructed and diffed for
//  every glass object on screen, on every update. SwiftUI's cost there is
//  generic-metadata lookup and tree comparison, and the profile showed exactly
//  that — `getGenericMetadata`, `initializeWithCopy`, `AGGraph` compares.
//
//  An Image is ONE node. That is the whole idea.
//
//  Keyed on everything the picture depends on and nothing else: the shape, the
//  size it is drawn at, whether it is prominent, and the palette. Content is
//  deliberately absent from the key — the lens stack never depended on what
//  sits inside it, which is precisely why it can be baked at all.
