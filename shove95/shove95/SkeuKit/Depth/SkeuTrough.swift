//  A trough is a channel cut THROUGH the material — the thing the reference's
//  nav bar actually is. It is not `skeuSurface(depth: .recessed)` with more
//  shadow; it is a different construction, and the difference is why the first
//  attempt read as a raised slab.
//
//  Transcribed from the Figma node (2:284), scaled from its 134pt bar height:
//
//    fill      linear #aa171f → #d7434f, top to bottom
//              (DARK at the top: the near wall shades the cavity.
//               The floor at the bottom is nearly the ground colour.)
//    contour   4.66px solid #85141a — darker than either stop
//    inner     inset  8.22  12.33 blur  8.22  black 0.25   ← from top-left
//              inset -8.25  -2.06 blur  8.25  black 0.25   ← from bottom-right
//              inset  0    -11.89 blur 29.71  black 0.30   ← up from the floor
//              inset  0     17.83 blur 11.89  black 0.25   ← down from the lip
//
//  All four are kept — dropping the two diagonal ones flattens it immediately,
//  they are what give the channel corners.
//
//  The ALPHAS and the floor shadow's radius are deliberately below the frame's
//  values (founder direction 2026-08-13: lighter than the reference itself, and
//  tighter). Figma renders these at 3.72× the phone size, where a 29.71 blur is
//  a narrow band along one edge; at 39.9pt it washes over the whole channel.
//  Blur does not scale linearly with perceived tightness, so the transcription
//  cannot be literal here.
