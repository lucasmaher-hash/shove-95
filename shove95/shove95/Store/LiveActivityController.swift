//
//  LiveActivityController.swift
//  shove95
//
//  Keeps the Lock Screen showing whatever the store says is pinned.
//
//  RECONCILIATION, not commands. The obvious shape is `pin() { start() }` and
//  `unpin() { end() }`, and it is wrong: a pin can also disappear because the
//  task was completed, deleted, archived, rolled over at midnight, or
//  un-pinned on another device and synced here. Each of those would need its
//  own call, and the first one anyone forgot would leave a ghost card on the
//  Lock Screen with no way to dismiss it.
//
//  So nothing calls "start" or "stop". `reconcile()` looks at the store and
//  makes ActivityKit match, and every mutation path already bumps
//  `TaskStore.revision`, which is what triggers it. One code path, and no way
//  to add a sixth way of losing a pin without it being handled.
//
//  THE 8-HOUR CEILING. iOS ends every Live Activity after at most eight
//  hours. The founder's answer (2026-08-16) is that the pin belongs to the
//  TASK, not to the activity: if the store says something is pinned and no
//  activity is running, this starts a fresh one. Since reconcile runs on
//  foreground, the pin feels open-ended as long as the app is opened now and
//  then — which is the honest version of "it stays until you turn it off".
