//  The tick button on the Lock Screen card.
//
//  `LiveActivityIntent` is the reason this feature needs no App Group. A
//  plain `AppIntent` on a widget button performs in the WIDGET's process,
//  which cannot reach the app's SwiftData store without a shared container —
//  and a shared container means an App Group, which means provisioning work
//  and a store migration. A `LiveActivityIntent` performs in the APP's
//  process instead: iOS launches the app in the background to run it, so the
//  store is simply there, exactly as the app always sees it.
//
//  The intent still has to be visible to BOTH targets — the widget needs the
//  type to build the button, the app needs it to perform — hence the package.
//  What it must NOT do is reach into the app's types from here, so the work
//  goes through a hook the app installs at launch.
