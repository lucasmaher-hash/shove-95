# PRD — shove.95

> Technical blueprint for coding agents. Read alongside `docs/design.md` (visual tokens — authoritative for every color, metric, and motion rule) and `docs/product-vision.md` (strategy). Where this document says "per design.md", the value there wins.

## 1. Overview

### Product Summary

**shove.95** — a to-do app with four time buckets where moving a task between days takes one swipe, wrapped in a pixel-faithful Windows 95 interface.

Tasks carry a real date (or none). The four tabs — Today, Tomorrow, Week, General — are *filters over that date*, never storage, so the app is always correct with zero rollover code. Swiping a row moves it one step along the line `Today → Tomorrow → Week → General`; a long-press context menu covers the longer jumps. The entire interface is Windows 95 rebuilt at 2× pixel scale.

### Objective

This PRD covers the v1 iOS MVP defined in `product-vision.md` § MVP Definition: the four date-derived tabs, the full gesture set (swipe-move, context menu, drag-reorder, inline add/edit), completion + archive, one photo per task, the complete Win95 visual system with stepped Dynamic Type, SwiftData + CloudKit sync, and a Settings screen (Archive, sync status, About). macOS is explicitly out of scope for v1 but shapes the architecture (shared logic package).

### Market Differentiation

The technical implementation must deliver two things to earn the product's positioning: **(1) a one-second, one-handed defer** — the swipe path must never route through a detail view, date picker, or confirmation, and must commit in a single gesture with the status bar as the only confirmation; **(2) a Win95 rendering that survives scrutiny** — every metric derived from the spec in `design.md`, no stock iOS chrome visible anywhere, and motion that is smooth but pixel-snapped.

### Magic Moment

Flicking a task from Today to Tomorrow with a thumb: swipe right → row slides off the screen edge → rows close the gap → status bar reads `Repair bike → Tomorrow` with an Undo button. Requirements this places on the implementation: gesture recognition must coexist with vertical scrolling without dead zones; commit must be instant (no spring-back-then-commit); the date write + placement must be synchronous so the destination tab is already correct if tapped immediately.

### Success Criteria

- Defer gesture completes (touch-down → row gone → status bar updated) in < 1s including animation
- App opens to a correct Today list after 3+ days unopened, offline, or across a timezone change — with no migration or rollover step
- A task created on one device appears on a second device signed into the same Apple Account without user action
- All P0 functional requirements pass their acceptance criteria; date/bucket logic covered by unit tests
- App Store approval

No server, no accounts, no third-party services. All logic runs on-device; CloudKit mirrors the SwiftData store silently.

### Chosen Stack

| Layer | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | SwiftUI (iOS 26 SDK, Swift 6.3, Xcode 26.6) | Native, first-party, best fit for heavy custom gesture work; view code reusable for macOS |
| Backend | None | Entirely on-device; CloudKit provides sync with no server |
| Database | SwiftData + CloudKit (`.private` database) | Modern persistence, direct SwiftUI integration, cross-device sync via one entitlement |
| Auth | None | CloudKit uses the device's Apple Account silently; no login exists |
| Payments | None | Free app |
| Analytics | None | Private personal app; privacy policy commits to zero third parties |
| Email | None | No accounts, no notifications |
| Error tracking | None (v1) | Xcode Organizer crash reports via App Store Connect |

### Stack Integration Guide

**Setup order:**

1. Xcode project `Shove95` (iOS App, SwiftUI, Swift), bundle ID `com.lucasmaher.shove95`, deployment target iOS 26.0, display name `shove.95`. Default MainActor isolation (Xcode 26 template default) — keep it; this app has no background threading needs.
2. Local Swift package `Shove95Kit` inside the repo (`File → New → Package`, add to project). Contains: `TaskItem` model, `Bucket`, `DateEngine`, placement logic, chip formatting. **Rule: nothing in Shove95Kit imports SwiftUI or UIKit.** This is the macOS-reuse boundary.
3. W95FA font: download from FontsArena (OFL license — keep the license file in the repo at `Shove95/Resources/W95FA-LICENSE.txt`), add `w95fa.otf` to the app target, register under `UIAppFonts` in Info.plist. Verify with `UIFont.familyNames` dump on first run.
4. SwiftData: `ModelContainer(for: TaskItem.self)` — **local-only at first** (`cloudKitDatabase: .none`). The model is written CloudKit-compatible from day one (defaults on everything, no unique constraints), but sync is switched on in its own phase.
5. CloudKit (requires paid Apple Developer account — hard prerequisite): add iCloud capability → CloudKit → container `iCloud.com.lucasmaher.shove95`; add Background Modes → Remote notifications; change `ModelConfiguration(cloudKitDatabase: .private("iCloud.com.lucasmaher.shove95"))`.

**Known gotchas:**

- **Naming:** the model class is `TaskItem`, never `Task` — `Task` collides with Swift Concurrency.
- **CloudKit + SwiftData constraints** (must hold from the first model version): every stored property has a default value or is optional; no `#Unique`; no non-optional relationships. The model below complies. Changing the schema after sync is enabled requires additive-only migrations.
- **CloudKit does not run on a free team.** Build everything before the sync phase against the local configuration.
- **Dates:** store `dueDate` normalized to start-of-day in the current calendar. All comparisons go through `Calendar` (never raw `Date` arithmetic across days). The app defines week-end as **Sunday** explicitly (see DateEngine) rather than trusting locale `firstWeekday`.
- **Day rollover:** there is no timer. Recompute on `scenePhase == .active` and on `UIApplication.significantTimeChangeNotification` (fires at midnight, timezone changes, clock changes). The rollover placement pass (see § Data Model) runs at those moments.
- **List vs custom stack:** start with `List` + `ForEach` (`.onMove` gives long-press-drag reorder without edit mode, `.contextMenu` gives the menu, and the system disambiguates hold-vs-drag — this is how Reminders works). The custom horizontal swipe gesture must be attached per-row with `.gesture(...)` tuned to fail on vertical movement so scrolling wins. **If List's gesture system fights the horizontal swipe irrecoverably, the sanctioned fallback is `ScrollView` + `LazyVStack` with hand-rolled reorder** — decided in the Phase 2 spike, not later.
- **Row identity:** stable `id` (the model's `id`) everywhere; animations depend on it.

**Environment variables:** none. **Secrets:** none.

### Infrastructure & Deployment

- **Distribution:** App Store via Xcode → Archive → App Store Connect. TestFlight on the founder's own device before submission.
- **CI/CD:** none for v1; local `xcodebuild test` for the Shove95Kit test suite.
- **Privacy policy hosting:** GitHub Pages from the repo (`privacy/`), URL entered in App Store Connect. Content: data stays in the user's private iCloud; the developer has no access; no analytics; no third parties.
- **App Store privacy questionnaire:** "Data Not Collected" (developer collects nothing; iCloud data is user-controlled).

### Security Considerations

- No credentials, tokens, or secrets exist in the app.
- All user data lives in the device's SwiftData store and the user's **private** CloudKit database — inaccessible to the developer by design.
- No network calls other than CloudKit's own sync. No input crosses a trust boundary; no injection surface.
- Photos are stored via `@Attribute(.externalStorage)` and never leave the private database.

### Cost Estimate

| Item | Cost |
|---|---|
| Apple Developer Program | $99 / year (hard prerequisite for CloudKit + App Store) |
| Servers, DB, analytics, email | $0 — none exist |
| CloudKit | $0 — user's own iCloud quota (a few MB of tasks + photos) |
| Privacy policy hosting | $0 — GitHub Pages |
| **Total** | **$99 / year** |

## 3. Data Model

### Entity Definitions

One entity. CloudKit-compatible: every property defaulted or optional, no unique constraints, no relationships.

```swift
import SwiftData
import Foundation

@Model
public final class TaskItem {
    public var id: UUID = UUID()
    public var title: String = ""
    /// Start-of-day date this task is scheduled for. nil = General (dateless).
    public var dueDate: Date? = nil
    public var isImportant: Bool = false
    public var isCompleted: Bool = false
    /// Set when ticked; cleared when unticked. Drives archive visibility.
    public var completedAt: Date? = nil
    public var createdAt: Date = Date.now
    /// Global manual ordering. Placement rules assign it once; drags mutate it. Fractional (midpoint) inserts.
    public var sortOrder: Double = 0
    /// True once the day-rollover pass has positioned this task in Today's overdue block.
    /// Reset to false whenever dueDate changes. Prevents re-placing a task the user has dragged.
    public var overduePlaced: Bool = false
    /// One optional photo, downscaled on import (max 2048px long edge, JPEG q0.8).
    @Attribute(.externalStorage) public var photoData: Data? = nil

    public init() {}
}
```

**Derived state — computed, never stored** (all functions in `DateEngine`, parameterized by `now` and `Calendar` for testability):

| Concept | Definition |
|---|---|
| `startOfToday` | `calendar.startOfDay(for: now)` |
| Bucket of a task | `general` if `dueDate == nil`; `today` if `dueDate < startOfTomorrow` (includes all past dates → overdue rolls forward automatically); `tomorrow` if within tomorrow; `week` if `dueDate > endOfTomorrow && dueDate <= weekHorizon` |
| `weekHorizon(now)` | The Sunday that ends the current week **if it is after tomorrow**; otherwise the following Sunday. (Encodes the Sat/Sun rollover: on Fri the horizon is this Sunday; from Sat it is next Sunday.) Week-end is Sunday by definition, independent of locale. |
| Target date for a move | `today → startOfToday`, `tomorrow → startOfTomorrow`, `week → weekHorizon(now)`, `general → nil` |
| `isOverdue` | `!isCompleted && dueDate != nil && dueDate < startOfToday` |
| `isArchived` | dated task: `isCompleted && completedAt < startOfToday` (visible struck-through only on its completion day); General task: `isCompleted && now - completedAt >= 24h` |
| Visible in tab T | matches T's bucket filter && `!isArchived` |
| Chip label | overdue 1–6 days: weekday abbreviation of `dueDate` (`Mon`); ≥7 days: `Nd` (e.g. `12d`) |

**The line:** `today ↔ tomorrow ↔ week ↔ general`. **Swipe right = defer** (one step toward General); **swipe left = pull forward** (one step toward Today). Reversed from the original spec on device feedback 2026-08-04: the taskbar reads Today | Tomorrow | Week | General left-to-right, so the row must travel the same direction as the destination tab — content follows the finger. Ends rubber-band. Context menu shows only non-adjacent destinations: from Today `> Week`, `>> General`; from Tomorrow `> General`; from Week `< Today`; from General `< Tomorrow`, `<< Today` (arrow = direction of travel, count = distance).

### Relationships

None. Single-entity model, intentionally.

### Indexes

None needed at personal-app scale (hundreds of rows). All filtering is in-memory over a full fetch sorted by `sortOrder`; SwiftData `#Predicate` filtering per tab is an optional optimization, not a requirement.

### Placement rules (write-once ordering)

Ordering is **placement-on-event + free manual reorder**, never a live sort:

| Event | sortOrder assignment |
|---|---|
| Create via add row | `maxVisibleSortOrder(in: currentTab) + 1` (bottom of incomplete section) |
| Swipe/menu move arrives in tab | bottom of destination's incomplete section; **if `isImportant`**: midpoint after the destination's last important task (or top if none) |
| Flag Important | `minVisibleSortOrder(in: tab) - 1` (jumps to very top) |
| Unflag Important | no change (stays where it is, loses red) |
| Complete / untick | **no change** — completed section renders separately, so unticking returns the task to its exact prior position |
| Day rollover pass | for each task with `isOverdue && !overduePlaced` (ordered by dueDate, then sortOrder): insert after the important block and any already-placed overdue tasks, before normal tasks; set `overduePlaced = true`. Runs on app-active and significant-time-change. Never touches tasks the user has since dragged (flag already true). |
| Drag reorder | midpoint of neighbors' sortOrders; if gap < 1e-9, renormalize the tab's visible tasks to integers |
| Any dueDate change | `overduePlaced = false` |

Rendering order within a tab: incomplete tasks by `sortOrder` ascending, then completed (non-archived) tasks by `completedAt` ascending, struck through.

## 4. API Specification

### API Design Philosophy

There is no network API — the app is local-first with CloudKit mirroring underneath SwiftData. This section specifies the **store façade** (`TaskStore`, `@Observable`) that views call. It is the only object that mutates the model context; views never touch `ModelContext` directly. Every mutation is synchronous on the main actor and immediately visible to all tabs.

### Store Operations

```swift
@Observable @MainActor
final class TaskStore {
    // ── Queries (computed from one fetch, filtered per DateEngine) ──
    func tasks(in bucket: Bucket) -> (active: [TaskItem], completed: [TaskItem])
    func archivedTasks() -> [Date: [TaskItem]]        // grouped by completion day, newest first
    var lastAction: LastAction?                       // drives the status bar

    // ── Mutations ──
    /// Creates in the given bucket with placement; empty/whitespace title → no-op.
    func addTask(title: String, in bucket: Bucket)
    func editTitle(_ task: TaskItem, to newTitle: String)   // empty result → delete? No: revert to old title
    /// One step along the line. Returns nil if at a dead end (caller rubber-bands).
    func step(_ task: TaskItem, direction: StepDirection) -> Bucket?
    /// Direct jump (context menu). Records undo, applies placement.
    func move(_ task: TaskItem, to bucket: Bucket)
    func toggleCompleted(_ task: TaskItem)            // sets/clears completedAt
    func toggleImportant(_ task: TaskItem)            // flag → jump-to-top placement
    func delete(_ task: TaskItem)                     // immediate; snapshot into lastAction for undo
    func reorder(_ task: TaskItem, betweenSortOrders a: Double?, and b: Double?)
    func attachPhoto(_ task: TaskItem, imageData: Data)     // downscales before storing
    func removePhoto(_ task: TaskItem)
    func undoLastAction()                             // restores move (date+order+flag) or resurrects delete
    func runDayRolloverPassIfNeeded()                 // called on scenePhase.active + time-change notification

    enum StepDirection { case deferOne   // toward General
                         case pullOne }  // toward Today
}

enum LastAction {
    case moved(taskID: UUID, title: String, to: Bucket,
               previousDueDate: Date?, previousSortOrder: Double, previousOverduePlaced: Bool)
    case deleted(snapshot: TaskSnapshot)              // full field copy incl. photoData
}
```

**Undo semantics:** single-level, persistent until the next undoable action replaces it (moves and deletes are undoable; completion is not — unticking *is* the undo). Undo of a move restores `dueDate`, `sortOrder`, and `overduePlaced` exactly. Undo of a delete re-inserts a new `TaskItem` with all fields from the snapshot (new UUID acceptable).

**Status bar text:** `"{title} → {Destination}"` for moves, `"{title} deleted"` for deletes, per the voice rules in `product-vision.md` (no exclamation marks, terse).

## 5. User Stories

### Epic: Time buckets

**US-001: See an honest Today**
As Lucas, I want Today to show everything dated today *plus* everything overdue, so that nothing silently disappears.
- [ ] Given a task dated yesterday and unfinished, when I open the app today, then it appears in Today with a date chip reading yesterday's weekday
- [ ] Given the app was closed for 5 days, when I open it, then all five days' unfinished tasks appear in Today, no rollover step visible
- [ ] Edge: task completed yesterday, dated yesterday → appears in Archive, not Today

**US-002: A Week that flows toward me**
As Lucas, I want tasks parked in Week to surface in Tomorrow and then Today as their day approaches, so that future tasks walk toward me on their own.
- [ ] Given a task dated Sunday, when Saturday arrives, then it appears in Tomorrow (and no longer in Week)
- [ ] Given it is Friday, when I view Week, then it shows only Sunday-dated tasks
- [ ] Given it is Saturday or Sunday, when I view Week, then it shows next week's range and swipe-to-Week targets next Sunday

### Epic: Moving tasks (the wedge)

**US-003: One-flick defer**
As Lucas, I want to push a task one step away with a left swipe, so that updating my plan costs nothing.
- [ ] Given a task in Today, when I swipe it **right** past the commit threshold, then it slides off the edge, the list closes the gap, its date becomes tomorrow, and the status bar shows `{title} → Tomorrow` with Undo
- [ ] Given a task in General, when I swipe **right**, then the row rubber-bands with a light haptic and nothing changes
- [ ] Given I swipe but release before the threshold, then the row springs back and nothing changes
- [ ] Edge: swiping during an active scroll → scroll wins; no accidental move

**US-004: One-flick pull-forward**
As Lucas, I want to pull a task one step closer with a **left** swipe.
- [ ] Given a task in Week, left swipe → it moves to Tomorrow
- [ ] Given a task in Today, left swipe → rubber-band + haptic, no change

**US-005: Long jump via menu**
As Lucas, I want to send a task straight across the line, so that General → Today is not three swipes.
- [ ] Given a task in General, when I long-press without moving, then the iOS context menu opens showing `< Tomorrow`, `<< Today`, `Mark as Important`, `Delete` (red, last)
- [ ] Given a task in Tomorrow, the menu shows exactly one move entry: `> General`
- [ ] Tapping `<< Today` moves the task to Today with important/bottom placement and updates the status bar
- [ ] Edge: menu never shows destinations reachable in one swipe

**US-006: Undo from the status bar**
As Lucas, I want the last move or delete undoable until I act again.
- [ ] Given I just moved a task, when I tap Undo, then it returns to its exact previous position (date, order, overdue flag)
- [ ] Given I deleted a task with a photo, Undo restores it with the photo
- [ ] The status bar entry persists until the next move/delete replaces it — no timeout

### Epic: The list

**US-007: Rapid inline capture**
As Lucas, I want to add several tasks without the keyboard closing.
- [ ] Given the add row is focused, when I type and hit return, then the task appends to the bottom of the active section and the keyboard dismisses
- [ ] Return on an empty field → nothing created
- [ ] The new task's date = the current tab's target date (General → nil)

**US-008: Inline edit**
As Lucas, I want to tap a task's text to fix a typo in place.
- [ ] Tap text → inline text field, keyboard up, cursor at end; return or tap-away commits
- [ ] Clearing the text entirely and committing → title reverts (delete is the menu's job)

**US-009: Completion that self-cleans**
As Lucas, I want ticked tasks to drop away on their own schedule.
- [ ] Tick → strikethrough + grey (per design.md), drops to the completed section at the bottom, no confirmation
- [ ] Untick any time → returns to its former spot in the active list
- [ ] A dated task completed yesterday no longer shows in its tab; it shows in Archive
- [ ] A General task completed 25h ago shows only in Archive
- [ ] A completed task never appears as overdue

**US-010: Manual order that's respected**
As Lucas, I want to drag tasks into my own order and have the app keep its hands off.
- [ ] Long-press-and-drag (finger moves) → reorder mode, row renders navy/white and follows finger; menu never appears
- [ ] Long-press-and-hold (no movement) → context menu; reorder never triggers
- [ ] After I drag a task somewhere, no automatic process ever moves it again (rollover pass skips `overduePlaced` tasks)
- [ ] Flagging Important jumps the task to the top; unflagging leaves it in place

### Epic: Photos

**US-011: Attach one photo**
As Lucas, I want to attach a photo to a task and view it big.
- [ ] Context menu (or add-row camera glyph) → system photo picker / camera; chosen image downscaled and stored
- [ ] Row shows a 64pt sunken-framed thumbnail beneath the text, aligned with the text
- [ ] Tap thumbnail → Win95 window viewer opens instantly (no animation), near-full-screen, navy title bar, pixel ✕
- [ ] Tap anywhere outside (or ✕) → closes instantly
- [ ] Edge: second attach replaces the first (one photo max)

### Epic: Sync & settings

**US-012: Silent sync**
As Lucas, I want my tasks on all my devices with no login.
- [ ] Task (with photo) created on device A appears on device B within ~a minute of both being online
- [ ] Full functionality offline; changes sync when back online
- [ ] Signed out of iCloud → app works locally; Settings shows `iCloud: not signed in`

**US-013: Archive & about**
As Lucas, I want yesterday's completions out of the way but not gone.
- [ ] Settings (title-bar gear) → Archive lists completed tasks grouped by completion day, newest first
- [ ] Archive rows: untick restores the task to its bucket; context-menu Delete removes permanently
- [ ] About shows version, W95FA font credit, tappable privacy policy link

## 6. Functional Requirements

Priorities: P0 = broken without it · P1 = incomplete without it · P2 = nice to have.

**FR-001: Date-derived buckets** — P0
Tabs are pure filters per DateEngine table (§3). No stored bucket, no rollover job. Acceptance: unit tests cover bucket assignment at boundary times (23:59/00:00), the Fri/Sat/Sun weekHorizon cases, and a 5-day-gap reopen. Related: US-001, US-002.

**FR-002: Swipe = one step** — P0
Custom horizontal drag on rows. **Right = defer, left = pull forward** (reversed 2026-08-04, see § Data Model > The line). The gesture must be hit-testable across the ENTIRE row, not just the drawn text. Commit: translation > 40% of row width **or** velocity > 800pt/s in the swipe direction. Below threshold → spring back. At line ends → rubber-band (resistance ~0.3× translation) + light haptic. On commit: row animates off the screen edge (motion snapped to the pixel grid per design.md § Motion), gap closes, model updates synchronously. Gesture must fail fast on predominantly-vertical movement. Related: US-003, US-004.

**FR-003: Context menu** — P0
`.contextMenu`: contextual move entries exactly per the table in §3, then `Mark as Important` / `Unmark Important`, `Attach photo` / `Replace photo` / `Remove photo`, then `Delete` (role: .destructive). Move entries labeled `< Tomorrow`, `<< Today`, `> Week`, `>> General` etc. Related: US-005, US-011.

**FR-004: Drag reorder + disambiguation** — P0
Hold-without-move → menu; hold-with-move → reorder (navy row follows finger). Midpoint sortOrder insert; renormalize when gaps vanish. Related: US-010.

**FR-005: Placement engine** — P0
Exactly the placement table in §3 — including `overduePlaced` semantics and the rollover pass trigger points (app active, significant time change). Acceptance: unit tests for each placement row, plus "dragged overdue task not re-placed next morning". Related: US-001, US-010.

**FR-006: Inline add** — P0
Permanent add row at list bottom (sunken field per design.md): return commits and **dismisses the keyboard** (reversed 2026-08-04 on device feedback); empty return no-ops; camera glyph attaches a photo to a task created from current text (if text empty, glyph no-ops). Related: US-007.

**FR-007: Inline edit** — P0
Tap text → edit in place. Commit on return or focus loss; empty → revert. Related: US-008.

**FR-008: Completion & archive** — P0
Tick/untick per US-009 rules; archive visibility per `isArchived` definition (§3). Archive screen grouped by day. Related: US-009, US-013.

**FR-009: Undo** — P0
Single-level `LastAction` for moves and deletes, surfaced in the status bar, persistent until replaced. Related: US-006.

**FR-010: Win95 visual system** — P0
Implement every component in design.md § Components with tokens from §§ 2–4: window + title bar (`{Tab} - shove.95`, gear control), sunken list well, task rows (checkbox, single-size text, red Important, trailing chip column, strikethrough+grey completed, navy drag state), status bar, taskbar (four text buttons, pressed active state, clock/date well, safe-area fill), photo viewer window, `(empty)` states. Prohibited-list (design.md §9) violations are bugs. Related: all.

**FR-011: Motion rules** — P0
Position animates (snapped to pixel grid); appearance is instant. Photo viewer + tab switches: no transition. Haptics: light impact on swipe commit and rubber-band; selection feedback on drag pickup/drop. Related: US-003, US-011.

**FR-012: Photos** — P1
One photo per task via PhotosPicker + camera; downscale ≤2048px JPEG q0.8 on import; `@Attribute(.externalStorage)`; 64pt thumbnail; instant viewer. Related: US-011.

**FR-013: CloudKit sync** — P1
`.private` database, container `iCloud.com.lucasmaher.shove95`. No login UI. Settings shows account status (`iCloud: available / not signed in / restricted`). Acceptance: two-device round-trip including a photo; offline edit syncs on reconnect. Related: US-012.

**FR-014: Settings / Archive / About** — P1
Gear in title bar → Settings (Win95 window): Archive, iCloud status row, About (version, font credit, privacy policy link opening in Safari). Related: US-013.

**FR-015: Stepped Dynamic Type** — P1
Map system content size to pixel scale: default sizes → 2×; large/xLarge accessibility bands → 3×; largest accessibility sizes → 4×. Entire UI (text, bevels, metrics) scales via the single `pixel` token. Layouts verified at all three; taskbar labels may abbreviate at 4× (`Tod / Tom / Wk / Gen`). Related: FR-010.

**FR-016: VoiceOver** — P1
Rows expose label (title + state: "important", "overdue since Monday", "completed") and custom actions: Complete/Uncomplete, Defer one step, Pull forward one step, Move to {each menu destination}, Delete. Taskbar buttons are tabs with selected state. The swipe being custom makes these actions mandatory, not optional. Related: FR-002, FR-003.

**FR-017: App icon & launch** — P1
32×32-style pixel-art icon (drawn from scratch — no Microsoft assets), exported at required sizes; launch screen plain `#C0C0C0`. Related: —.

**FR-018: Empty states** — P2
`(empty)` centered per design.md. Archive empty: `(empty)`. Related: US-013.

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Cold launch to interactive Today list < 1.0s on the founder's device
- Steady 120fps during swipe, drag, and scroll on ProMotion (no dropped-frame bursts in Instruments)
- Any tap/gesture → visible feedback < 100ms
- App binary < 20MB; typical database (500 tasks, 30 photos) < 100MB iCloud usage

### Security
- Zero secrets, zero network endpoints beyond CloudKit; privacy questionnaire = Data Not Collected

### Accessibility
- Tap targets ≥ 44pt (checkbox visual 24pt with expanded hit area)
- Stepped Dynamic Type per FR-015; VoiceOver per FR-016
- Meaning never carried by color alone (red + top-tier placement; chip + block position; strikethrough + grey)

### Scalability
- Correct and smooth at 1,000 tasks / 100 photos (personal-app ceiling; in-memory filtering is acceptable at this scale)

### Reliability
- Fully functional offline, indefinitely; no data loss across force-quit, reboot, or reinstall-with-iCloud
- Date logic correct across timezone changes, DST, and midnight-while-open (recompute triggers per §2)
- CloudKit conflicts: last-writer-wins (CloudKit default) is acceptable for a single-user app

## 8. UI/UX Requirements

Visual styling lives in `docs/design.md` — components referenced by name. This section covers structure, states, and interactions.

### Screen: Main (Today / Tomorrow / Week / General)
Route: root; four tabs share one screen, switched by taskbar. **Structure (top→bottom):** TitleBar (`{Tab} - shove.95`, gear → Settings) · SunkenWell containing the task list + AddRow · StatusBar (last action + Undo) · Taskbar (4 buttons + clock well).

States:
- **Empty:** `(empty)` centered in the well; add row still present at bottom
- **Loading:** none — SwiftData is synchronous at this scale; first frame is populated
- **Populated:** incomplete by sortOrder → completed struck-through → AddRow last
- **Error:** none reachable (no network in the view path)

Key interactions:
- Taskbar tap → instant tab switch (no transition); active button renders pressed
- Swipe row L/R → FR-002 · Long-press → FR-003 menu · Long-press-drag → FR-004 reorder
- Tap checkbox → toggle complete · Tap text → inline edit · Tap thumbnail → photo viewer
- Tap Undo in StatusBar → FR-009
- Clock well: displays current date + time (non-interactive)

Components: Win95Window, TitleBar, SunkenWell, TaskRow, DateChip, AddRow, StatusBar, Taskbar, Win95Checkbox.

### Screen: Photo viewer (overlay)
Opens instantly over everything; near-full-screen Win95Window: TitleBar (task title, ✕ control), image in sunken frame on `#C0C0C0` body. Tap ✕ or anywhere outside → instant close. No zoom/pan in v1. Not draggable.

### Screen: Settings
Presented from gear (full-screen Win95 window, title `Settings - shove.95`, ✕ returns). Rows as raised-bevel list items: **Archive** → Archive screen · **iCloud** status line (`iCloud: available` / `not signed in`) · **About** → About screen.

### Screen: Archive
Title `Archive - shove.95`. Sunken well; sections per completion day (`Today — 3 items`, `Mon 28 Jul — 5 items`), newest first. Rows: struck-through text + checkbox (tick state on). Untick → task leaves archive, returns to its bucket. Context menu: Delete (permanent, no confirmation — but records nothing in undo; acceptable, it's two deliberate steps). Empty: `(empty)`.

### Screen: About
Title `About - shove.95`. Static: app name + version/build, "Typeface: W95FA by Alina Sava (SIL OFL)", `Privacy policy` link (opens Safari), © line.

### Onboarding
None. First launch lands on empty Today. The interface is the tutorial; the status bar teaches the swipe result on first use.

## 9. Auth Implementation

This app does not require authentication — CloudKit binds to the device's Apple Account with no login surface. If auth is ever added (it should not be), revisit this section.

## 10. Payment Integration

Free app, no payments. Section intentionally empty.

## 11. Edge Cases & Error Handling

### Feature: Date engine
| Scenario | Expected behavior | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Midnight passes while app foregrounded | On next significant-time-change notification: filters recompute, rollover pass runs, Today updates in place | P0 |
| App opened after N days | All accumulated overdue appear in Today; rollover pass places only never-placed ones | P0 |
| Timezone change / DST | All boundaries derive from `Calendar.current` at read time; no stored day boundaries to invalidate | P0 |
| Device clock set backwards | Tasks may appear "in the future" in Today's filter — accept (filter is `< startOfTomorrow`, future-dated beyond tomorrow simply appear in their buckets); no crash | P2 |
| Saturday/Sunday Week semantics | weekHorizon rolls to next Sunday; Week tab never empty-by-construction | P0 |

### Feature: Gestures
| Scenario | Expected behavior | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Diagonal swipe | Vertical dominance → scroll; horizontal dominance → swipe; no simultaneous both | P0 |
| Swipe at line end | Rubber-band + haptic, no mutation | P0 |
| Long-press then slight tremor (<10pt) | Still menu, not reorder | P1 |
| Swipe during inline edit | Commit the edit first, then normal gesture handling | P1 |
| Rapid consecutive swipes on different rows | Each commits independently; status bar shows the latest | P1 |

### Feature: Data & sync
| Scenario | Expected behavior | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| iCloud signed out / restricted | Local-only operation; Settings shows status; no prompts, no errors | P0 |
| Same task edited on two offline devices | CloudKit last-writer-wins; no user-facing conflict UI | P1 |
| Photo import very large / HDR | Downscaled ≤2048px JPEG before store; failure → task saved without photo, no crash | P1 |
| iCloud quota full | CloudKit stops syncing; app keeps working locally (SwiftData unaffected) | P2 |
| Delete syncs while task open in edit on other device | Edit target vanishes; view dismisses gracefully via id-based rendering | P2 |

### Feature: Input
| Scenario | Expected behavior | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Return on empty add row | No task created, field stays focused | P0 |
| Edit cleared to empty | Revert to previous title | P0 |
| Very long title | Truncates with `…` before the chip column (design.md); full text visible in edit mode | P1 |
| Paste multiline text into add row | Newlines collapsed to spaces | P2 |

## 12. Dependencies & Integrations

### Core Dependencies
**None.** No SPM/CocoaPods packages. Apple frameworks only: SwiftUI, SwiftData, CloudKit (via SwiftData), PhotosUI, UIKit (font registration + haptics only).

### Development Dependencies
Xcode 26.6 toolchain; Swift Testing (bundled) for Shove95Kit tests.

### Third-Party Services
| Service | Used for | Cost / requirement |
|---|---|---|
| Apple Developer Program | CloudKit entitlement + App Store distribution | $99/yr — **must exist before FR-013** |
| iCloud / CloudKit | Sync, private database | Free (user quota) |
| GitHub Pages | Privacy policy URL for App Store Connect | Free |
| W95FA typeface (FontsArena, Alina Sava) | The app's single font | Free, SIL OFL — bundle license file, credit in About |

## 13. Out of Scope

**Revised 2026-08-14:** dark mode has SHIPPED and is no longer out of scope — Light / Dark / System as one global `AppearanceMode`, with dark palettes for all five Win95 schemes plus the skeu look. See `design.md` §1 for the structural rules the dark palettes obey. A second design mode (`DesignMode.skeu`, soft skeuomorphism) also ships alongside the Windows 95 look; see `SKEUOMORPHIC_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` and `skeu-mode-plan.md`.

Per `product-vision.md` § Explicitly Out of Scope, all deferred with reasoning there: notifications/reminders (v1.1 — most valuable deferred feature), macOS app (immediately post-v1; Shove95Kit exists for it), multiple photos, recurring tasks / subtasks / tags / projects / search / collaboration (permanently, barring proven daily need), statistics/streaks (brand-incompatible), data export (pre-requisite only if external users ever matter). Also out of scope for v1: iPad-optimized layout (iPhone layout runs compatibly), widgets, Watch, Siri/Shortcuts, localization (English UI only).

## 14. Open Questions

1. **App icon artwork.** Pixel-art direction locked (no Microsoft assets); the actual drawing is undecided. Options: a pixel hand mid-shove, a tilted red arrow, a bevelled "95". Owner: Lucas, before the App Store phase. *Default if undecided: bevelled raised square with a pixel right-arrow glyph.*
2. **Week-end = Sunday** is hard-coded by design (German/ISO convention). Confirm acceptable if the phone's locale ever differs. *Default: keep Sunday, locale-independent.*
3. **Archive retention.** Currently: forever, delete manually. Revisit only if the archive grows annoying. *Default: keep forever.*
4. **Delete inside Archive is permanent with no undo.** Accepted? *Default: yes — it is two deliberate steps deep.*
5. **Clock well format.** `Tue 03.08.` vs `12:04` vs both stacked. *Default: date on top of time, both in W95FA 8px×scale — decide visually in the styling phase.*
